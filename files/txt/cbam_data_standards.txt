COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2024/249
of 30 November 2023
amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 as regards common data requirements for the purposes of exchange and storage of certain information under the customs legislation
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code
(
1
)
, and in particular Article 7, points (a) and (b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Annex A to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446
(
2
)
sets out the common data requirements for the exchange and storage of information required for applications and decisions. With a view to a major upgrade of the electronic systems related to the Customs Decisions System (CDS) and the Guarantee Management system (GUM), that Annex should be amended in order maintain harmonisation.
(2)
The practical implementation of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 in combination with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 has shown that amendments need to be made to that Delegated Regulation to improve the harmonisation of the common data requirements for the exchange and storage of information between customs authorities as well as between customs authorities and economic operators. Such amendments are necessary to maintain the inter-operability between the customs electronic systems used for the different types of declarations, notifications and proof of customs status of Union goods that are set out in Annex B to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446. It is therefore necessary to amend that Annex.
(3)
It is necessary to complement the information that is collected for the registration of third-country economic operators that have a permanent business establishment in the customs territory of the Union. The address of this permanent business establishment should be recorded. Moreover, the common data requirements for the registration of economic operators set out in Annex 12-01 to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 should be better aligned with those for applications and decisions as well as for declarations, notifications and proof of customs status of Union goods to ensure interoperability between the electronic system used for the registration of economic operators and those which process applications and decisions as well as for declarations, notifications and proof of customs status of Union goods. It is therefore necessary to amend Annex 12-01.
(4)
It is necessary to defer the application of of those changes that have a significant impact on electronic systems to allow the Commission, Member States authorities as well as economic operators to adapt their electronic systems accordingly and to give time to Member States and economic operators to comply with the amended data requirements. Some of the amendments are already taken into account in the current IT development whilst other amendments will require changes to electronic systems which are not yet planned. Member States as well as economic operators need a stable basis in order to prepare for these changes and to arrange the necessary investments. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce amendments to the data requirements which will only apply in 1 to 4 years after the entry into force of this Regulation depending on the specific developments in IT.
(5)
The specimens of the Transit Accompanying Document as set out in Annex B-02 to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 and the Transit/Security Accompanying Document as set out in Annex B-04 to that Delegated Regulation as well as the Lists of Items to those documents as set out, respectively, in Annex B-03 and B-05 to that Delegated Regulation need to be aligned with the common data requirements for the transit procedure set out in Annex B to that Delegated Regulation. Since the common data requirements applicable for the Transit Accompanying Document and the Transit/Security Accompanying Document are very similar, it is no longer necessary to have two different specimens of those documents and the related Lists of Items. It is therefore necessary to amend those Annexes B-02 and B-03 as well as to delete those Annexes B-04 and B-05.
(6)
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 should therefore be amended accordingly,

ANNEX I
‘ANNEX A
COMMON DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS AND DECISIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2(1)
TITLE I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1
General interpretation notes
(1)
The provisions included in these notes are applicable to all Titles of this Annex.
(2)
The data requirement tables in Title II include all the data elements necessary for the applications and decisions dealt with in this Annex.
(3)
The formats, codes and, if applicable, the structure of the data requirements described in this Annex are specified in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447.
(4)
The data requirements defined in this Annex shall apply to applications and decisions made by using an electronic data processing technique as well as to paper-based applications and decisions.
(5)
The data elements which may be provided for several types of applications and decisions are set out in Title II, Section 1, Group 31-38 of this Annex.
(6)
The data elements specific to certain types of applications and decisions are set out in the data requirements section for Group 42-63 of Title II of this Annex.
(7)
The specific provisions concerning each data element as they are described in the data requirements section of Title II of this Annex apply without prejudice to the status of the data element as defined in the data requirements tables. For example, D.E. 35 01 080 Identification of goods is marked as mandatory (status “A”) in the data requirements table in Title II, Group 35 of this Annex for the authorisations of inward processing (column IPO) and outward processing (column OPO); however that information shall not be completed in case of inward or outward processing with equivalent goods and outward processing with standard exchange system, as described in Title II, Group 35 notes of this Annex.
(8)
The status markings (“A”, “B” or “C”) pertaining to the data element concerned in the respective data requirement table indicate that they may be used for the purposes of the applications (marked with “*”), the decisions (marked with “+”) or for both (no specific mark).
(9)
The status listed in the data requirement table below is not affected by the fact that certain data is provided only where circumstances warrant it. For example, the D.E. 35 01 060 Equivalent goods shall only be used, if the use of equivalent goods in accordance with Article 223 of the Code is requested.
(10)
The status markings (“A”, “B” or “C”) applied at data element (class) level need to be considered together with the indicated, possible modifications at data sub-element (sub-class or attribute) level and with the provisions of the indicated numbered footnote(s) in the requirements table in Title II Section 2. In case the status and or footnote is provided at class level it is applicable for all data sub-classes or data sub-elements unless different statuses or footnotes applied at a data sub-class or data sub-element. For example, status “A” is indicated at class level for D.E. 33 02… (Applicant/Holder of the authorisation or decision identification) for most of the columns, but D.E. 33 02 000 230 (VAT number) is only required for the AEO column.
(11)
If the application for the use of a special procedure other than transit is made in accordance with Article 163, the dataset defined in column A163 of the data requirement table in Title II of this Annex shall be provided in addition to the data requirements of the customs declaration, as provided for in Title I, Chapter 3, Sections 1, 2 and 11, of Annex B in relation with the procedure concerned.
(12)
Member States shall provide to the Commission a list of data elements marked as status “B” in the data requirements tables they require and they shall inform the Commission of any changes to that list. The Commission shall publish the list of those particulars.
(13)
In the data requirements tables in Title II (Data Requirements with notes) Section 2 (Data requirements table for data group 31-38) only those data elements are shown which have actual requirement status indicated.
(14)
The data requirements for the specific columns (datasets related to specific applications or decisions) shall be applicable in different phases. The corresponding phase is indicated in Title I, Section 2 (Table legend) of this Annex. The date of applicability for the various phases are the following:

‘ANNEX B
COMMON DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR DECLARATIONS, NOTIFICATIONS AND PROOF OF THE CUSTOMS STATUS OF UNION GOODS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2(2)
TITLE I
DATA REQUIREMENTS
CHAPTER 1
Introductory notes to the data requirements table
(1)
The declaration messages contain a number of data elements only some of which will be used, depending on the customs procedure(s) in question.
(2)
The data elements which may be provided for each procedure are set out in the data requirements table. The specific provisions concerning each data element as they are described in Title II apply without prejudice to the status of the data elements as defined in the data requirements table. The provisions that apply to all situations where the data element concerned is requested are included in the heading “All relevant data requirements table columns used”. In addition, the provisions that apply to specific table columns are included in specific sections that refer precisely to those columns. Both sets of provisions need to be combined to reflect the situation of each table column.
(3)
The “A”, “B” or “C” symbols listed in Chapter 2, Section 3 below have no bearing on the fact that certain data is collected only where circumstances warrant it. For example, the supplementary unit (status “A”) will only be collected where required by the Union legislation, as published in TARIC.
(4)
The “A”, “B” or “C” symbols defined in Chapter 2, Section 3 may be complemented by conditions or clarifications listed in the footnotes attached to the data requirements tables of Chapter 3, Section 1 to 12 below.
(5)
If the Member State of acceptance of the customs declaration allows, a customs declaration (columns series B and H) or a simplified declaration (columns series C and I) can include items of goods which are subject to different procedure codes, providing that these procedure codes all use the same dataset as defined in Chapter 3 and belong to the same column of the matrix as defined in Chapter 2. However, the possibility to have different requested procedure codes, shall not be used for customs declarations lodged in the context of centralised clearance where more than one Member State is involved pursuant to Article 179 of the Code.
(6)
Without affecting in any way the obligations to provide data according to this Annex and without prejudice to Article 15 of the Code, the content of the data provided to customs for a given requirement will be based on the information as it is known by the economic operator that provides it at the time it is provided to Customs.
(7)
The exit or entry summary declaration that must be lodged for goods leaving or entering the customs territory of the Union contains the information detailed in columns A1 and A2 and F10 to F51 of the data requirement table of Chapter 3 below, for each of the situations or modes of transport concerned.
(8)
The use within this annex of the words entry and exit summary declarations refer respectively to the entry and exit summary declarations provided for under Articles 5(9) and 5(10) of the Code.
(9)
Columns A2, F30, F31, F32, F33 and F34 of the data requirements Table of Chapter 3 below cover the required data which is provided to customs authorities primarily for safety and security risk-analysis purposes prior to departure, arrival or loading of express consignments.
(10)
For the purposes of this Annex, an express consignment means an individual item carried via an integrated service of expedited/time-definite collection, transport, customs clearance and delivery of parcels whilst tracking the location of, and maintaining control over such items throughout the supply of the service.
(11)
Where column F50 of the data requirements Table of Chapter 3, Section 9 below applies to road transport, it also covers cases of multimodal transport, unless otherwise provided in Title II.
(12)
The simplified declarations referred to in Article 166 of the Code contain the information detailed in columns C1 and I1.
(13)
The reduced list of data elements provided for procedures in columns C1 and I1 does not limit or influence the requirements set out for the procedures in the other columns of the data requirements table, notably in respect of the information to be provided in supplementary declarations.
(14)
The formats, codes and, if applicable, the structure of the data requirements described in this Annex are specified in the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447.
(15)
Member States shall notify the Commission of the list of particulars they require for each of the procedures referred to in this Annex. The Commission shall publish the list of those particulars.
(16)
